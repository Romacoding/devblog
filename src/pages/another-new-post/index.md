At the beginning of last year, I had finally decided that I wanted to learn a programing language, so I searched the internet for many hours studying what would be the language I should learn and is in demand.

I found that there is a large need in people who know web development. I started out with HTML and CSS then focusing on JavaScript. Iâ€™m still need to gain a in-depth knowledge of frameworks and libraries used in modern web development, but learning new things always excites me and motivates to become a better programmer.
