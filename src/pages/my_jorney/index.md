title: My jorney as a programmer

I was introduced to the programing languages back in 2000 when I was a freshman in high school. It was an introductory course on a Turbo Pascal. I remember solving simple coding tasks and not really understanding how the information I was learning was related to my everyday life. I donâ€™t think it was ever explained to us how fast technology is becoming a inseparable part in many professional fields and even households (at that time only few people I know had a PC at home). Had I known, I might have began a career in programing a long time ago.
